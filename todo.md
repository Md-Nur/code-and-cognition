In home page What does it mean by Partnership process. Does it understandable with a client who is a non technical person?

In this website make sure the portfolio and our previous work are the same one thing. they are not different and client can see it easily. Is the running task is called projects? then there have a didcated page for portfolio not running projects

You can add a chat with whatsapp or messenger option so that client can easily chat with us

When I tries to add a portfolio, there ask for image url, but there is no option to upload image and in the select services there is no option to select sub-services
