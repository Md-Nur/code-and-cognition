When I tries to add a portfolio, there ask for image url, but there is no option to upload image and in the select services there is no option to select sub-services

if any user is admin, then show an admin button instead of login button

add an search option for services and sub-services so that client can easily find the services. the search must be efficient, fast and user-friendly

Add the facebook link in the footer and the thread icon is not appropriate

One thing is that our landing page is all one, but we will have multiple landing pages, that is, if you click on the service menu bar, another landing page will open, where all the services will be together, then if you click on them again, for example, if you click on Digital Marketing and Advanced ACO, another landing page will open, which will have Facebook Marketing and Instagram Marketing separately. Don't chage the current cards just add new buttons on the cards
