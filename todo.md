Act as a UX strategist.

Refactor my public Services page.

Currently:
- Shows Basic / Plus / Pro pricing cards.

I want to:

- Remove fixed pricing display.
- Replace with solution-based sections.
- Add “Request Proposal” CTA instead of “Buy Now”.

Structure:

Section 1:
Headline: “Structured Digital Execution for Growth-Focused Companies”

Section 2:
Three Core Pillars:
- Digital Platforms
- Intelligent Automation
- Growth Systems

Section 3:
Engagement Approach (Strategy → Build → Scale)

Section 4:
CTA:
“Schedule Strategic Consultation”

Generate:
- New page layout
- Tailwind-based components
- No pricing grid
- Enterprise minimal style

Act as a backend product architect.

Remove direct Plan selection from booking flow.

New Booking Flow:

4. Founder generates Proposal:

5. Client approves proposal
6. Project is created

Implement:

Generate:
